# NBA-assists-analysis

This is a data analysis project of how NBA positions interact by exploring NBA assist records from the past two decades. 
We used assist data from 2003, 2011, and 2022 to determine that 1) NBA positions are becoming much more dynamic as traditional position roles change and 2) teams have a greater tendency to play two of the same positions at the same time.
These conclusions were gathered from an increase in SG assists as well as more assists from two positions of the same category.
I conducted this work alongside classmates Aidan Orr and Andrew Fu as a final project for our STAT-231 Data Science course.
